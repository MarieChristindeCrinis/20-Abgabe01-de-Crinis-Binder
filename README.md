This project is used to practice the use of GitHub and Unit Tests.
To reach this goal, we used the project Drink to practice.

In order to learn how to use GitHub and Unit Tests, we decided to
extend the class *Drink* with the class *Cocktails*.

In the class *Cocktails*, we create a List of Ingredients
that a Cocktail is made of.

To learn how to work with Unit Tests, we create the
test class *CocktailTest* to fill the Ingredient List.
